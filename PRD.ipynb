    "Product Requirements Document (PRD) Project Title: EdTech Chatbot Integration \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction: \n",
    "The EdTech Chatbot Integration project aims to develop a chatbot into an educational technology platform to enhance user experience, provide personalized learning support, and offer assistance with various educational tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Objectives:\n",
    "Implement a conversational interface to facilitate interactions between users and the platform. Assist users with queries related to course content, assignments, exams, and general educational information. \n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Features:\n",
    "- Conversational Interface: Enable users to interact with the chatbot via natural language input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Educational Assistance: Provide answers to queries related to course materials, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Wireframes: on seperate file\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Functional Requirements: \n",
    "- User Interface: Design a user-friendly chat interface for seamless interaction with the chatbot. \n",
    "- Query Handling: Implement natural language processing to understand and respond to user queries effectively. \n",
    "- Feedback Mechanism: Incorporate a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the chatbot's responses and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Non-functional Requirements: \n",
    "- Scalability: Design the chatbot system to handle a large number of concurrent users. \n",
    "- Performance: Optimize response times to provide quick and accurate responses to user queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Dependencies: \n",
    "- Technology Stack: Natural Language Processing (NLP) frameworks such as NLTK. \n",
    "- Machine learning libraries like PyTorch, Tkinter. \n",
    "- Front-end technologies for the chat interface (e.g., React, Vue.js). \n",
    "- Backend technologies for handling user requests and data processing (e.g., Node.js, Django). \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Risks: \n",
    "- NLP Challenges: Potential difficulties in understanding and processing user queries accurately. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. Stakeholders: Development Team, Product Managers, Educators, Students \n",
    "\n",
    "10. Acceptance Criteria:\n",
    "- Successful integration of the chatbot into the platform. Chatbot effectively responds to user queries and provides personalized recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "11. Future Enhancements: Integration with learning management systems (LMS). Support for additional languages. Enhanced natural language understanding capabilities through continuous learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "12. Conclusion: The EdTech Chatbot Integration project aims to enchance the educational experience by providing users with a personalized and interactive learning assistant. With its conversational interface and advanced capabilities, the chatbot will empower learners to achieve their educational goals more efficiently and effectively.\n"
